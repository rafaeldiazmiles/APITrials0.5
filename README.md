Episodio V: Rise of the middleware


Captain's log:
Up to date this file contains some simple errors to be corrected. They come from several trials that dont appear reflected in this final job. Here we are learning to add some middleware in the server-client talking that we've been learning in this API odissey. We use them to release from cumbersome our dearest clients and servers. Here we check that the input comes in JSON "language" (with one middleware) and we add a timestamp to it (in the other middleware).

The APITrials0.5 folder has the older version, the APITrials has the newer one.
